    <ol style="margin-bottom: 20px">
        <li>First of all, bake <b>carrots</b> and <b>potatoes</b> in the oven! Put them on a sheet of foil, salt, pepper, add a little vegetable oil.
        Wrap and send them to the oven for 45 minutes at 180-200 degrees centigrade
        </li>
        <li>Then cool them down and now scrape the skin off them</li>
        <li>Cut the vegetables into medium sized chunks and throw them into a large bowl</li>
        <li>Dice the <b>pickles</b> into small cubes and put them in a bowl</li>
        <li>Pre-baked <b>beef</b> in foil (200 degrees centigrade - 45 minutes), cut into medium cubes and send to a bowl</li>
        <li>Dice the pre-boiled <b>eggs</b> and put in a bowl</li>
        <li>I prefer to use frozen <b>peas</b>, they give their zest and make the salad more interesting, add them to the salad</li>
        <li>Cut the <b>mandarin</b> in half and add to the <b>mayonnaise</b>, mix and dress the salad</li>
        <li>Salt, a little freshly ground pepper and mix gently!</li>
